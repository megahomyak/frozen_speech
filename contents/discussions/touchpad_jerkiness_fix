I've rebooted the hardware component already, I don't want to restart the X session because a lot of stuff will be killed. What can I do to fix this?

* Laptop on the table
* Phone near the touchpad
* Under the phone on the keyboard drawer there is a graphics tablet
* I'm writing on the graphics tablet at the moment, the tip of the pen is close to the desk surface where the phone is located

My setup when I try to debug this:
* All devices are far away from each other)
