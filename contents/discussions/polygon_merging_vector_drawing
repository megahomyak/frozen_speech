text(Idea: make a program for vector drawing, where all brushes will only produce polygons, and there will be layers, and on each layer all groups of overlapping polygons will merge into one polygon. In this way, both drawing in vector and avoiding an infinitely growing file will be possible (that is, the size will be approximately constant, like with raster; maybe for optimisations some nearby edges will be merged into one edge between them). But there will be no curves, which is not very good. I don't know what to do with them. Do you have any ideas?)
